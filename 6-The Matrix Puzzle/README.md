# Decode Secret Image

This project provides a Python-based approach to **decode hidden information from images**. It is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook (`decode_secret_image.ipynb`) and demonstrates techniques in image processing and steganography.

## 🚀 Features

* Load and process images.
* Extract hidden/secret data encoded within images.
* Visualize the original and decoded outputs.
* Step-by-step implementation in a Jupyter Notebook.

## 📂 Repository Structure

```
.
├── decode_secret_image.ipynb   # Main notebook with decoding logic
├── README.md                   # Project documentation
└── requirements.txt            # Python dependencies (optional)
```

## ⚙️ Requirements

* Python 3.8+
* Jupyter Notebook
* Required libraries:

  * numpy
  * matplotlib
  * opencv-python
  * pillow

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ▶️ Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/prathu2k4/Marvel01/tree/main/6-The%20Matrix%20Puzzle
   cd decode-secret-image
   ```
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
3. Open `decode_secret_image.ipynb` and run the cells step by step.

## 📖 How It Works

1. The notebook reads the input image.
2. Applies decoding logic (pixel/bit manipulation).
3. Extracts the hidden/secret image or message.
4. Displays the decoded output.

## 📝 Example

* Input: Encoded image with hidden data.
* Output: Decoded hidden image/message revealed inside.

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to fork this repo, open issues, or submit PRs to enhance the decoding methods.


Would you like me to also **generate a `requirements.txt`** automatically from your notebook so the README is fully ready for Git?
