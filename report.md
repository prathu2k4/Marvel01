# Task 2: API Project

## Learning Outcome

* Understood **“What is an API?”** and its role in enabling communication between different applications.
* Gained hands-on experience in integrating a third-party **Weather API** into a web application.

![Weather App Preview](https://github.com/prathu2k4/Marvel01/blob/16b7f2e98b6ee51a634548c092e1dc2e0201c194/Api/Images/search.png)


A **Weather Web Application** was developed that fetches and displays real-time weather data using a selected Weather API. The application provides an interactive and responsive user interface with multiple features.

## Features Implemented

*  **Search weather details by city name**
*  **Displays temperature, humidity, wind speed, and pressure**
*  **Shows weather condition with an icon** (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy)
*  **Fetches and displays the local time of the searched city**
*  **Responsive, mobile-friendly design** for smooth user experience across devices

# Task 3: GitHub Workflows

I familiarized myself with GitHub integrated workflows by learning how repositories and contributions are managed. I forked the given repository and successfully cloned it to my local system. I explored the existing issues, worked on the assigned task, and implemented the required changes. Finally, I committed and pushed my work to my forked repository, completing the task as instructed.

# Task 4: Ubuntu Command Line

![img](https://github.com/prathu2k4/Marvel01/blob/main/4-Ubuntu%20Command%20Line/img1.jpg)
In this task, I practiced basic Ubuntu command line operations. I created a folder named `test` and navigated into it using `cd`. Inside the folder, I created a blank file with the `touch` command and listed files using `ls`. I also generated 2600 folders with patterned names such as `M_1` `M_2` `M_3` and so on using loop commands. Finally, I concatenated two text files and displayed the combined output in the terminal. This task helped me become more familiar with essential Linux commands.

# Task 5: Linear Regression from Scratch


I implemented Linear Regression from scratch using Gradient Descent on the California Housing Prices dataset. The model was trained without using ML libraries for optimization, ensuring a clear understanding of the underlying math.
I compared my custom implementation against Scikit-learn’s LinearRegression, and both achieved identical performance (MSE: 0.7091, MAE: 0.6299, R²: 0.4589). The results confirm that gradient descent converges to the same solution as the analytical closed-form method. I also visualized the line of best fit along with the data points, validating the correctness of my model.
This project strengthened my understanding of regression, error metrics, and optimization techniques.

# Task 6: The Matrix Puzzle — Decode with NumPy & Reveal the Image

I have successfully completed the project "Decode Secret Image" using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The notebook demonstrates how to process images and extract hidden information using libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, and ImageIO. The decoding process was implemented step by step, making it easy to understand the working of image manipulation concepts. The project achieves its objective of revealing the hidden data embedded inside an image. This work enhances my understanding of image processing and secret data handling techniques.

I have successfully completed the development of my personal portfolio website. The site includes sections for About, Skills, Projects, and Achievements, with smooth animations and responsive design. I implemented advanced features like a loading screen, dark/light theme toggle, smooth navigation, and parallax scroll effects.The website is fully responsive and designed to provide a modern, engaging user experience.

# Task 9: Tinkercad Circuit

I successfully created a Tinkercad account and explored its interface to understand the example circuits provided. I then designed and simulated a simple circuit using an ultrasonic sensor to measure the distance of an obstacle, displaying the results on the serial monitor. To extend this, I built a radar system by integrating a servo motor with the ultrasonic sensor. The servo motor sweeps the sensor across a range of angles, enabling wider area scanning. The ultrasonic sensor measures distances by emitting sound waves and detecting their echo time. The simulation successfully displayed distance readings, demonstrating effective object detection within the radar’s coverage area.

# Task 10: DC Motor Speed Control

I successfully completed the task of speed control of a DC motor using an Arduino UNO and the L298N H-Bridge motor driver. A 5V BO motor was connected to the driver, and PWM signals were generated from the Arduino to vary the motor speed. By adjusting the PWM duty cycle through the program, I was able to achieve smooth control over the motor’s rotation. The setup was tested with different speed levels, and the motor responded accurately to the programmed inputs.

# Task 11: LED Toggle Using ESP32

I successfully completed the task of creating a standalone web server using the ESP32. The ESP32 was configured as an Access Point and hosted a web page that allows wireless control of an LED connected to GPIO2. Using the Arduino IDE, I set up the ESP32 board configuration and uploaded the program. The web interface was designed with Bootstrap and JavaScript for an interactive user experience. By clicking the ON and OFF buttons, I was able to toggle the LED state in real-time. This task helped me understand ESP32 networking, GPIO control, and web server programming.

# Task 16: Datasheet Report

I have prepared a report on the **MQ135 gas sensor** by referring to its datasheet. The sensor is capable of detecting gases such as **ammonia, benzene, smoke, and CO₂**, with high sensitivity and a wide detection range. In my report, I have analyzed its **operating voltage, load resistance, and response time**, along with its applications in air quality monitoring. The findings were systematically studied and compiled to highlight the sensor’s working principle and performance.
