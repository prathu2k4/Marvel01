# Task 2: API Project

## Learning Outcome

* Understood **“What is an API?”** and its role in enabling communication between different applications.
* Gained hands-on experience in integrating a third-party **Weather API** into a web application.

![Weather App Preview](https://github.com/prathu2k4/Marvel01/blob/16b7f2e98b6ee51a634548c092e1dc2e0201c194/Api/Images/search.png)


A **Weather Web Application** was developed that fetches and displays real-time weather data using a selected Weather API. The application provides an interactive and responsive user interface with multiple features.

## Features Implemented

*  **Search weather details by city name**
*  **Displays temperature, humidity, wind speed, and pressure**
*  **Shows weather condition with an icon** (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy)
*  **Fetches and displays the local time of the searched city**
*  **Responsive, mobile-friendly design** for smooth user experience across devices

# Task 4: Ubuntu Command Line

[![img](https://github.com/prathu2k4/Marvel01/blob/main/4-Ubuntu%20Command%20Line/img1.jpg)
In this task, I practiced basic Ubuntu command line operations. I created a folder named `test` and navigated into it using `cd`. Inside the folder, I created a blank file with the `touch` command and listed files using `ls`. I also generated 2600 folders with patterned names such as `M_1` `M_2` `M_3` and so on using loop commands. Finally, I concatenated two text files and displayed the combined output in the terminal. This task helped me become more familiar with essential Linux commands.
